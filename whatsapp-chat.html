                <div class="text">Putting the male security aside for one minute, the fact that he had you strip searched is what's illegal here, and then with male security makes it even worse, especially with you being a trans-woman. </div>

                <div class="text">They are not allowed to do that, only a police officer can do that and for that type of search I think it has to be done in the station. I also heard he took your money of you as well

                <div class="text">I donâ€™t think there were any cameras' cos it wasnâ€™t in the office, it looked more like a storeroom. Fortunately cos most places are card only I didnâ€™t have much cash on me, but they still took what I had Â£80-Â£100</div>

                <div class="text">That's absolutely theft - I believe you without needing video evidence. During Elliot's time at EGG, he repeatedly messaged me bragging about catching dealers.
                <br><br> He knew exactly what he was doing - strip searching them, taking their drugs AND stealing their cash for himself.

                            He would then spend that stolen money on designer clothes without ever involving police.

                        Those dealers might accept losing their drugs to avoid trouble, but taking their money crosses another line entirely.<br><br> I'd hate to think what might happen if any of them discovered where he works or lives now - it could end very badly for him.
